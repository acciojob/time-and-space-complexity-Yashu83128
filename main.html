		<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
		<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program. It is very important to understand time complexity as it helps us to be efficient in our coding.</p>
		<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another important concept which refers to the total space or memory taken by an algorithm to execute its output. For example, an algorithm that requires O(n) space will need space proportional to the input size.</p>
